# Class-specific-Data-Augmentation-for-Plant-Stress-Classification
An approach for automated class-specific data augmentation using genetic algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on soybean leaf stress classification. Our approach yields substantial results, achieving a mean-per-class accuracy of 97.61%  on the soybean leaf stress dataset.
